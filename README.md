# Dark Resume

Dark Resume is based on [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) - a CV theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). The theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume.

## Setup

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/RaunoT/dark-resume`

After installation, run `npm install` and then `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved.
