# Dark Resume

Inspired by [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) - a CV theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). Dark Resume takes the original concept even further, by adding tons of animations and giving the whole thing a dark makeover for a classier and stealthier look. The theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections, to build a simple yet elegant resume.
