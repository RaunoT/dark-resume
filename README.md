Improves on the original concept of [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), by adding tons of animations and giving the whole template a dark makeover for a classier and stealthier look. The theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections, to build a simple yet elegant resume.

## Setup

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/RaunoT/raunot-home`

After installation, run `yarn` and then `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files and live reload the browser when changes are saved.

## Gulp Tasks

* `gulp` - Default task that compiles Sass, concatenates CSS & JS files, creates sourcemaps and pulls dependencies

* `gulp dev` - Runs Browsersync in your browser to live reload any changes made

* `gulp dist` - Builds everything and moves it into **dist** folder for production
