# Rauno T | Homepage, powered by Dark Resume

Dark Resume takes the original concept of [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) even further, by adding tons of animations and giving the whole template a dark makeover for a classier and stealthier look. The theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections, to build a simple yet elegant resume.

## Setup

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/RaunoT/raunot-home`

After installation, run `yarn` and then `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files and live reload the browser when changes are saved.
